*TL; DR: CrashTheRobot.com is a multi-author blog encouraging best practice engineering and thinking for practical robotics.* 

## The Manifesto ##

Science Fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke postulated that "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."  
 
We at CrashTheRobot.com explore and explain practical solutions for today's safety problems in advanced technology areas like robotics, AI software, and, drones.
 
We promote technology that can save and improve human lives, not harm or put human lives at risk. 
 
We encourage conversation that treats advanced technology as something that can and should be understood by all.
 
We discourage treating today's robots, AI, and software systems as magic. 
 
We crash robots.

## The Robot Reading Levels ##
This is a technical blog, but everyone can love robots! With that in mind:

Robot Reading Level: General
No mathematics or industry knowledge needed. Pop culture snippets, ethics discussions, and personal opinions about robots.

Robot Reading Level: Tech Savvy
Contains high school level physics or algebra and basic engineering concepts. Detailed legal discussions using technical definitions may ensue.

Robot Reading Level: Engineer or Maker
Posts contain source code, the word "Bayesian" in any context, detailed algorithmic descriptions, and other fun stuff appropriate for a Maker, a designer, an engineer, or an adventurous robotics student.

Robot Reading Level: Robotics Academic
Reviews and responses to content from technical journals or robotics conferences. Warning: Here be thesis dragons!
