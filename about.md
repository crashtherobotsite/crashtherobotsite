*TL; DR: CrashTheRobot.com is a multi-author blog encouraging best practice engineering and thinking for practical robotics.* 

## The Manifesto ##

Science Fiction writer Arthur C. Clarke postulated that "any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."  
 
We at CrashTheRobot.com explore and explain practical solutions for today's safety problems in advanced technology areas like robotics, AI software, and, drones.
 
We promote technology that can save and improve human lives, not harm or put human lives at risk. 
 
We encourage conversation that treats advanced technology as something that can and should be understood by all.
 
We discourage treating today's robots, AI, and software systems as magic. 
 
We crash robots.
