*TL;DR: The Trolley Problem is an interesting philosophical problem to explore ethical dilemmas. However, recent media focus on the Trolley Problem is misplaced. The creation of phantom self-driving cars that decide who lives or dies distract from today's very real ethical problems concerning self-driving cars and the tech companies that build them.*

# An Old Thought Experiment Reborn

The Trolley Problem is a thought experiment designed to tease out the moral consequences of *actively* taking an action that will save some lives and doom others.  It was originally authored by philosophers trying to study the morality of abortion.  It was not authored explicitly with self-driving cars in mind.  However, some MIT researchers rebooted it with self-driving cars, and named it 'The Moral Machine,' a website-based thought experiment to tease out what [people's moral stances on such actions actually are](http://moralmachine.mit.edu/).

The MIT research project site lists more than 2 dozen 'selected media' that wrote articles about their experiment, including: the New York Times, the Guardian, The Times, Newsweek, PBS,  Scientific American, Popular Science,  TechCrunch, New Scientist, Wired, the Huffington Post, and many more.   Good job philosophy researchers! 

However, this research experiment relies on the acceptance of a second fictional premise: that a self-driving car can be programmed with software that takes a moral position on who to save in an emergency.   We run into a problem when the media ignores the fact that this **is patently not possible** with present technology, and hand-waves away that fact with statements like "in 5 or 10 years cars will do X".   After all, everyone loves a story about [murderous future technology from a giant evil corporation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-fN82upbGPo) - straight from science fiction to real life! 

# The President Misses the Point
>"...what are the values that we’re going to embed in the cars? There are gonna be a bunch of choices that you have to make, the classic problem being: If the car is driving, you can swerve to avoid hitting a pedestrian, but then you might hit a wall and kill yourself. It’s a moral decision, and who’s setting up those rules?"
>-[President Barack Obama in Wired interview, October 2016](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/president-obama-mit-joi-ito-interview/)

The all time high of "Missing the Point" occurred in October 2016, with *Wired* highlighting it in a excerpted interview with President Obama.  

It's not that the trolley car decision isn't important, but the media seized on this problem and the Internet proliferated it for the same reason college roommates like to talk about the meaning of life after a few rounds of beer:  it's an easily-visualized philosophical problem that uses a colorful metaphor with no official wrong answer.  Plus, it has a web-site! 

The philosophy problem was introduced as a relevant news topic as if self-driving cars were capable of making that decision now, and **the tech is not there yet.**  Having a nationwide argument about it is camouflage for the very real ethical dilemmas (related to self-driving cars and not) that both the American government and companies like Google, Apple, Uber and Tesla have right now. Among them: 
    

 - Companies accusing government regulators of being 'anti-technology' because their safety concerns might hurt corporate profits.
 - Local governments having to balance public safety in the testing of cars versus the economic benefits of being known as a tech-friendly town. 
 - Uber's not paying existing drivers [anything resembling a living wage](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/hidden-costs-driving-uber-john-mcdermott) and attempting to replace these drivers with self-driving cars
 - Apple and Tesla's potential sourcing of  battery materials from  supplies from [cobalt mines worked by starving child laborers.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/business/batteries/congo-cobalt-mining-for-lithium-ion-battery/)
 - Google using a favorable interpretation of legal requirements to [under-report how many times its test drivers took over from a self-driving car](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jan/12/google-self-driving-cars-mistakes-data-reports). 
 - How regulators will handle legislating a [potentially impossible burden of proof](http://www.rand.org/blog/2016/05/why-its-nearly-impossible-to-prove-self-driving-cars.html) that would show self-driving cars are safe enough.

 
Focusing on widespread media coverage on the Trolley Problem ignores real ethical dilemmas in favor of fantastical ones. At this point in time, informed technologists,  media authors among them, have a responsibility to look at the real issues. Ones that might not have a website with cute illustration.
