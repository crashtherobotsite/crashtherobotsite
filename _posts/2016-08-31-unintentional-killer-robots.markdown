*TL;DR: 10 unintentionally fatal robots from the 1980s through today provide a glimpse of the safety challenges that all engineers face, but also highlight safety challenges unique to AI and robots. All engineers have to worry about broken components, material wear, human interactions, realistic testing, and potential product misuse. Roboticists have to worry about additional factors such as invisibile complexity, unproveable safety factors, expectations based on Hollywood, and others.*
