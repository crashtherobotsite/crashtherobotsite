*TL; DR: The FAA's Part 107 rules allow for small autonomous drones to be used in commercial settings as long as the drone has designated human babysitter. Part 107's rules for all drones, piloted and not, provide a bar that small unmanned drones will have to be able to hit before they can be allowed to function with less human supervision. This post develops these laws into more detailed engineering specs to investigate where the biggest technical challenges will be in the next few years.*

## Autonomy is in... with adult supervision## 
In June 2016, the United States Federal Aviation Administration released new rules for the use of Unmanned Small Aircraft in the form of [Part 107](http://www.faa.gov/uas/media/RIN_2120-AJ60_Clean_Signed.pdf). The 624 pages of rules come after the FAA solicited public input and guidance in late 2015. The overarching demand for the new rules is political and commercial in nature, and the [FAA press release](https://www.faa.gov/news/press_releases/news_story.cfm?newsId=20515) encourages drones and drone companies that *"work to harness new innovations safely, to spur job growth, advance critical scientific research and save lives."*

The bulk of Part 107 establishes a general process for getting a drone operator's license (and who needs one), lays out what size and type of drones can be used for a commercial drone businesses, and excludes certain higher risk technologies that will still require going through the older process with more cumbersome additional permits.  [A shorter summary document](https://www.faa.gov/uas/media/Part_107_Summary.pdf) neatly lays out what we at CrashTheRobot.com really care about: the rules for *whether or not your drone can fly itself.* The answer to that last question is a pretty enthusiastic "Yes!"

The Part 107 summary states that while a drone can fly autonomously, a pilot must:
    * ...maintain Visual Line of Sight with the drone, 
    * ...be able to see the drone with with the naked eye,
    * ...only fly one drone at a time,
    * ...have the necessary Part 107 license to fly an autonomous UAV,
    * ...and finally, *follow all the other safety rules in Part 107.*
 
While these rules prevent truly economical use of autonomous drones, the FAA is practically begging companies to prove that the rules are too stringent. In an effort to curtail any criticism of holding back technological progress, the FAA has made it clear that all of Part 107 rules can be exempted with a special waiver process that will be available through an online portal by the end of 2016. If you've got the latest and greatest self-flying tech but it's over 55lbs or you want to use it for night-time flying, you are welcome to show it off to the FAA and get a special permit under Section 333 like [Amazon or all of these companies](https://www.faa.gov/uas/getting_started/fly_for_work_business/beyond_the_basics/section_333/333_authorizations/):  

*"Most of the restrictions discussed above are waivable if the applicant demonstrates that his or her operation can safely be conducted under the terms of a certificate of waiver."*

In other words, the U.S. Government wants YOU to improve drone technology... so let's see how a  state-of-the-art autonomous drone might be made to follow the new safety rules. 


## The Breakdown ##
The Part 107 rules that apply to piloted and autonomous drones provide a nice window into the technical challenges facing the next generation of drones. We'll break them down into 5 categories:

*Easy* rules can already be followed by autonomous drones.

*Hard* rules will require either very conservative drones or some serious engineering work. 

*Outlawed* rules cover activities forbidden to human pilots that a robot might be able to do very well and safely, like flying fast or at night.  These items are presently forbidden because no drones have proven the ability to do tasks like this safely and repeatably. 

*Contradictory* rules are too ambiguous for present AI to handle. This may include rules that even a human is going to have a hard time following. Rather than technological improvements, the *law* is what would have to be clarified rather than the AI.  

*Impossible* rules are physically impossible or cannot be followed safely. These are rules that humans will break in a time of emergency (like ignoring traffic lights when your brakes have gone out) or when it is safer to break the rule than to follow it (like driving under the speed limit on the Jersey Turnpike around New York City, which puts your car going 30MPH slower than the cars around it).
