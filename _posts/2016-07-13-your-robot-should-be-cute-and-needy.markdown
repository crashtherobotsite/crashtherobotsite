*"What is a robot? It's hardware as complex as a laser printer that was developed at MIT."* -A cynical engineer. 

"*I WANT A TAMAGOTCHI!"* -[76 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi) screaming children worldwide.


In 1996, I was 9 years old, and Tamagotchi had just been released to the world. A Tamagotchi was a keychain-size toy, a plastic egg with a little black and white pixel screen, a cartoon drawing no more than a 20x20 pixel smiley face that moved around with a screen refresh rate of less than 10Hz, a tiny robot pet creature that required you press buttons for it to live or it died in a matter of hours. It was useless, beeping, distracting, easily breakable, banned in my classroom at school, and I wanted one DESPERATELY. 

In 2016, I am 29 years old, and smart appliances are everywhere. Smart washing machines, laser printers, Keurig coffee machines, and vending machines are all examples of machines that take in sensor input, make choices, and do a task with actuators that produces a visible result for me.  I don’t refer to them as pets, or robots. I don't have robots. I have appliances. They do chores I would have to do otherwise, but I don't like them. I don't have affection for them. I curse at them when they break. 

While toy robots continue to be popular, when a piece of semi-autonomous technology becomes well understood and useful beyond being a toy, we quit calling it a robot.  Even though there is no formal definition for what is a robot and what isn’t, smart appliances have for the most part failed to capture our imaginations the way toys and science fiction robots do. The science fiction ideal of the “singularity”, where a robot might become self aware (or at least autonomous enough to do the dishes!) seems as far away as ever, and the disillusioned consumer doesn’t call their new appliance a “robot dishwasher”.  Don’t expect a [cartoon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tamagotchi!_%28anime%29) about one any time soon either. 

There is a notable exception to this rule: iRobot's Roomba.  After more than a decade on the market, the Roomba product line and its competitors are housed in a product category called "Robot Vacuums".  The 2016 high-end Roomba [retails for \$900.](http://www.cnet.com/products/irobot-roomba-980/) The Robot Vacuum market is valued at [$2.5 BILLION dollars](http://www.marketsandmarkets.com/PressReleases/cleaning-robot.asp) in 2016 and growing, but Amazon.com doesn't even have a "Robot Coffeemaker" shopping category. I checked. Why? Why only robot vacuums and not robot espresso machines? 

I believe the answer resides with the Tamagotchis. The "robot vacuum" has stuck around as a premium product and vocabulary word longer than the "robot soda dispenser" because it is the right size and has the right motion to be treated as a pet. As something "alive." Robot vacuums are small and cute. They feed that part of us that wants to give affection to puppies and babies and Tamagotchis. iRobot knows this as well as Bandai did. The lesson here for wannabe potential entrepreneurs and business developers is that you, too, can capitalize on this feeling. 

I want someone to make me a snarky robot espresso machine. One that raises an eyebrow at me on Cappuccino Number Four of the day.  Better yet, make a washing machine that droops and looks sad when you don't wash anything in it. See how fast you can train a 9 year old to do laundry if you tell her that the “pet” washing machine will starve if you don’t feed it dirty clothes! 

But lest you think that humans are too easily manipulated into thinking useless things are cute, remember that your cute washing machine has to continuously provide new tricks, new amusement if it’s going to be treated as a toy AND an appliance. That's a tall order for a washing machine. After all, my parents did give in and get me that Tamagotchi as a present. I cared for it. But I forgot about it under the couch eventually. And then one day, my very real dog found it. And ate it. True story.
